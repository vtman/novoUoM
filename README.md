<h2 id="link_coin">Finding coincident events</h2>

The experimental setup contains a set of scintillation bars. Detector elements are positioned at the ends of these bars and record the signal's waveforms generated by scintillations within the bars. Digitiser boards are connected to detector elements and can acquire data. There are several channels for each board (for the current boards we may have up to 16 channels). By default, signals from the opposite ends of scintillation bars are in pairs (neighbouring odd/even indices of the channels). The index of the channels start from 0. Channels 14 and 15 are not in use.

The system records data as ROOT files (see <a href="https://root.cern/">CERN website</a>). Each ROOT file contains a set of trees corresponding to digitiser boards. There may be other trees in the file; however, we store all data in trees named <b>dta</b>, <b>dtb</b>, etc. Each tree contains columns of data called branches. All branches within one tree have the same number of elements (entries).

Note that a digitiser board writes data in chunks. We cannot guarantee that the events are in order within a chunk. However, consequent chunks are in order, i.e. an event within a chunk <tt>I</tt> is always before any event from chunk <tt>I+1</tt>. The size of the chunk varies, but it is possible to estimate its maximum size.

The goal is to identify those scintillation events that may be responsible for multiple scintillation events within different scintillation bars. Therefore, we first need to find scintillation events occurring within a short time frame within one bar, i.e. timestamps corresponding to a pair of odd/even channels (of the same bar) are close to each other (short-time). Then, among all possible pairs of such events, we find pairs of events that are within a large time frame (long-time). We ignore all other scintillation events.

The goal is to have an input ROOT file, perform various processing and get an output ROOT file containing all the data as the original input file but only for coincident events.



<h3 id="link_coin_extract">extractTimeStamps: extract time stamps from ROOT files</h3>

We consider all trees in an input ROOT file that have three-symbol names and start with <b>dt</b>. We ignore all other trees. For each tree, we create a binary output file containing information about the time stamps. We assume that there are at least three branches in each tree and there are branches named <tt>channel</tt> (1 byte), <tt>timestamp</tt> (4 bytes) and <tt>timestampExtended</tt> (2 bytes). For each scintilaltion event we form a 18-byte block of data: 4 bytes of <tt>timestamp</tt>, 2 bytes of <tt>timestampExtended</tt>, 2 bytes of zeros, 8 bytes of the entry's index, 1 byte of <tt>channel</tt>, 1 byte of the gigitiser board's index). While we have only <tt>32 + 16</tt> bits for the time stamp, we pad the number to form the <tt>64</tt>-bit number.

<h3 id="link_coin_radix">treeRadixSort: sort the binary data accoring to the time stamps</h3>

We consider the binary files formed on the previous step. Time stamps are the first 64 bits for each 16-byte block of data. We use the simplest version of the radix sort algorithm. Starting from the least-significant bit, we form two blocks of data corresponding to <tt>0</tt> and <tt>1</tt> values for the chosen bit, then concatenate these two blocks and consider the next bit. To speed up the processing, we find the smallest time stamp and subtract it from all entries we consider, the perform the radix sort and add up the original time stamp. In this way we have to consider less bits.

The code is designed to be used for multiple threads. We split the original records onto large chunks of rows, sort them and save to the final file. As we do not know the size of blocks used by the digitiser board to write the data to ROOT files, there is a chance that time stamps for large blocks in the current code are not in order for neighbouring blocks. Therefore we need to perform another radix sorting near the interfaces of these blocks.
